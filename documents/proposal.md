# Movie Explorer

As someone who is interested in international feature films, I am always lost as to what films I should watch. Instead of sifting through
various top 10 lists on the internet, it would be nice to have a tool that I can use to query films based on the primary language 
spoken and their average rating. I plan on using a combination of The Movie Database (TMDB) and the Open Movie Database (OMDB). The former can query for properties other than titles while the latter contains average IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes scores.
