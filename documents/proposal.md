# Movie Explorer

As someone who is interested in international feature films, I am always lost as to what films I should watch. Instead of sifting through
various top 10 lists on the internet, it would be nice to have a tool that I can use to create my own lists. Having a tool to query films based on the primary language spoken or country of production in conjunction with their average rating would be helpful. Additionally querying by year released and genre would also help in the search for films to watch.  

I plan on using a combination of The Movie Database (tMDB).

# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

The SEO is the practice of increasing quality and quantity of organic traffic to your website. You want to make sure that the traffic to your site is intentional and is what the user was looking for, and you want to generate traffic free of cost. 

## Ideal SEO Implementation

- Identify our ‘value proposition’. What are we creating that makes it unique? What are the terms describing the customer problem and our solution to that?

- Understand our digital competitors. 

- Creating an effective information architecture that reduces the number of clicks away from the homepage to allow search engines and users to find content in as few clicks as possible.

- Implement responsive design

- Optimize with Python or R! Using common tools of data science to gather data and evidence of traffic on your own site rather than relying on speculation. The data analysis on log files for example and other metrics is allowing you to tell a story about the website and its traffic.
